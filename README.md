# 04 - Coding-Quiz-Game!

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

For this project, I was required to create a coding quiz using Javascript. The quiz app will run in the browser and work as follows:

Opening the page, the user will be shown a screen with rules and a start button.

Upon clicking the button, the screen will show the first of multiple choice questions and the timer will start counting down from 90 seconds.

For each question, if the user clicks the correct answer, their score will increment and 'correct!" will display below the quiz. If the incorrect answer is clicked, 15 seconds will be be deducted from the timer and "wrong!" will display below the quiz.

Once the timer ends OR all the questions have been displayed, the screen will display the "All done!" message together with the user's score and an input field to input initials.

Upon inputting the initials and clicking submit, the input will be validated and the initials/score pair will be stored in local storage.

The user will then be sent to a High Scores page that will display the high scores with the initials (This data will be retrieved from local storage). The user will also be presented with two buttons, one to Go Back to the quiz and one to clear the high score and remove it from local storage.

This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

WHEN I click the start button

THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question

THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly

THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over

THEN I can save my initials and my score

## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

I have submitted BOTH of the following for review:

* The URL of the functional, deployed application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a readme describing the project.
